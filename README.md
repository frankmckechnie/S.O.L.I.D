# S.O.L.I.D with PHP

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

With this project I have create 5 classes that cover each principle. With time I will update the project with real life examples.
